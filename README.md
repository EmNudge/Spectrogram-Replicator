# Spectrogram Replicator

This is a spectrogram replicator. It is an educational linguistics tool to teach about spectrograms and how they work.

A spectrogram is a different way to represent audio than a standard waveform. Frequencies shape the image, while volume colors it. By tracing over spectrograms of human speech, one can replicate the sound using sine waves.

## Technologies
This project uses Svelte and Typescript. Svelte was instrumental in the ease of use the reactivity has been, while TypeScript makes refactoring much easier in general.
