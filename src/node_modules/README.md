# Okay, so this might look a bit weird.

## The problem
I ended up recently dealing with frustrating relative imports.

This led to an even more frustrating experience with `@rollup/plugin-alias`. As it turns out, I'm doing *something somewhere* which breaks Svelte's reactivity when I import modules using aliases. I found that `src/components/lineManager/Manager.svelte` was importing stores, but it was not updating to anything when changes were made to the same store.

**Theory**: relative imports were importing a copy of the export, but not a reference of it. This means that when other modules updated the reactive data structure, my module wasn't receiving anything as it had a completely separate variable that only happened to have the same name.

Regardless, I need absolute imports, but this solution seems to break things. 

## The Solution
I was passed a tweet from Rich Harris which discussed using `node_modules` to create absolute imports.

Essentially, you can create a `node_modules` folder in `src/` to have the same effect as the normal top-level `node_modules` folder. You get absolute imports without rollup plugins.

Folders that often need to be imported will be placed here. I'm not sure I like it aesthetically, but it will have to do until I find a way to get import aliasing working.

## What Goes Here
At the moment, I only want to move things here that I have to. Nothing usually breaks if exports are copied, but stores **need** to shared, so we can't use export aliases. Stores will therefore be the one thing we must move to `node_modules`.
